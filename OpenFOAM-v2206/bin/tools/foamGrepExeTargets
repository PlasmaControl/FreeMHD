#
# Description
#     Trivial script to lists all "EXE =" targets for solvers and utilities.
#     Uses git for the grep operation.
#
# Examples
#     Confirm that all available EXE targets have actually been created:
#
#       foamGrepExeTargets           > targets-available
#       foamGrepExeTargets -appbin   > targets-created
#       diff -uw targets-available targets-created
