# Snippets for documentation


3.1 Command-line options:

* -eextension

  Output code extension, the default is 'c'.
  Changing this will not change the type of code generated (it will
  still be C) but it does allow triggering of different make rules
  or diffferent compiler types.


3.2.2  Interface Summary

Notes:

* Use the %name directive to change the "Parse" prefix names of the
  procedures in the interface.

* Use the %static directive to change the interface type defined by
  YYFUNCAPI to file `static` linkage. This can be useful if the entire
  parser code is to be locally wrapped inside of a different caller.



4.4  Special directives

* %static



4.4.xxx The %static directive

By default, the functions generated by Lemon are exposed as globally
visible symbols. You can change this by specifying the %static
directive.

This places parser routines in a static (ie, file-local) scope so that
they are not visible outside of the compilation unit. The parser
routines will then be wrapped with some other type of mechanism.
