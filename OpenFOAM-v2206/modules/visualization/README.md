## About

A collection of visualization interfaces for OpenFOAM, primarily
VTK/ParaView based.


### paraview-plugins

Reader plugins for ParaView which are sometimes termed _paraFoam_
(even although that is just a script).

The readers are partly historical and partly with features that are
not yet supported by the regular OpenFOAM readers from VTK.

However, they are also lacking some features that the regular OpenFOAM
readers from VTK have.


### runTimePostProcessing

An _insitu_ visualization function-object using VTK with pre-defined
functionality for geometry and scenes.


### catalyst

An _insitu_ visualization function-object using ParaView/Catalyst.
