# Patterns used to check silent configuration file
#
# anythingpat - any string
# filepat     - the file location pattern (/file/location/to/license.lic)
# lspat       - the license server address pattern (0123@hostname)
# snpat       - the serial number pattern (ABCD-01234567)
# comppat     - the component abbreviation (intel-component-0123.4-567__arch), use installer command line option to get it
