ERROR: This variable has a changing shape over time, so bpls cannot dump it as a global array. 
You can dump a single step with
    bpls -d AlternatingStepsAndChangingShapeVar -s "T,0,0" -c "1,-1,-1"
where T is a number between 0 and 4,
or dump each block separately with 
    bpls -dD AlternatingStepsAndChangingShapeVar
