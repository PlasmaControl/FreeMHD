## MP4 video writer now available on Windows

A new movie writer that produces H.264-encoded MP4 files is now available. This writer, available on Windows only, uses Microsoft Media Foundation to perform the encoding. `vtkMP4Writer` has a `Rate` property to set the frame-rate of the output video and a `BitRate` property to set the quality of the encoded file.
