## Add the ability to adding interactive 2D widgets from ParaView

 - add the ability to adding interactive 2D widgets
 - add Equalizer filter with interactive 2d widget as example
 - add vtkFFT class that provides methods to perform Discrete Fourier Transforms. For more information on vtkFFT and everything related with the FFT, see section `Better support of the FFT in VTK`

 ---

Here is an example of using vtkEqualizerFilter and vtkEqualizerContextItem.

Source data:
![Equalizer filter and Interactive 2D](interactive_2d_before.png  "Equalizer filter")

After applying the filter:
![Equalizer filter and Interactive 2D](interactive_2d_after.png  "Equalizer filter")
