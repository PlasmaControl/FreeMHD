##  Vector Field Topology in `vtkVectorFieldTopology`

The filter `vtkVectorFieldTopology` computes the topological skeleton of a 2D or 3D vector field given as .vti, i.e. critical points and separatrices. In 2D separatrices are lines. In 3D, they are surfaces computed through the new filter `vtkStreamSurface`.
