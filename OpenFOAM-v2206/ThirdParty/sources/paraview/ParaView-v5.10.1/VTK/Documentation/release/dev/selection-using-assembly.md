## Selection qualifiers using data assembly

Selections can now be qualified to limit to a chosen subset of blocks in a composite
dataset using a collection of xpath selectors for a data assembly (or hierarchy)
associated with that dataset. This is not much different that using
composite-index, for example, to qualify a selection except that it is more
flexible and expressive.
