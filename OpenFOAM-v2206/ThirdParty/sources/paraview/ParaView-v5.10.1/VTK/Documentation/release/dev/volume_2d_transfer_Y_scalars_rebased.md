## Enable independent scalar array for y-dimension of 2D transfer functions for volume rendering

Previously, 2D transfer function were limited to being defined as a single scalar field along the x-axis and its gradient along the y-axis. 2D transfer functions for volume rendering may now be defined by two separate arrays, one for the x-axis, and one for the y-axis.
