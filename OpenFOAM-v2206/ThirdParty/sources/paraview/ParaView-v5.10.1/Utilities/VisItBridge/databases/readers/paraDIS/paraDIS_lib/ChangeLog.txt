Well, better late than never.  Introducing a changelog for the paraDIS library. 

2013-04-25: version 2.3
        Implemented MetaArm visualization, including subsetting by some new variables in the meshes.  Using enumerated scalars now for better subset operations.  
        We now have metaarm visualization.  
        Added several new variables, some having to do with meta-arms, cleaned up variable naming convention, and converted some into enumerated scalars to allow subset operations to work. 
        Added the ability to write out so-called tagfiles, which are simply a copy of the original data with certain values replaced by "8" when a node is in a LOOP metaarm.  
        
2013-05-24: version 2.3.1
       Various bugfixes to make the code actually produce results that are consistent with previous results. 
       Added tools to track history of arms after decomposition of higher energy arms into lower energy arms. 
       Simplified the arguments to analyzeParaDIS to make visualization easier. 
2013-05-29: version 2.3.2
       Detach any "pass-through" arms from terminal nodes before decomposing any arm.  

2013-05-30: version 2.3.3
       Enable the creation of "trace files" which allow user to track what happens to particular arms visually and in text
