 * pqHandlePropertyWidget is a custom property widget that uses
 * "HandleWidgetRepresentation" to help users interactively set a 3D point in
 * space. To use this widget for a property group
 * (vtkSMPropertyGroup), use "InteractiveHandle" as the "panel_widget" in the
 * XML configuration for the proxy. The property group should have properties for
 * following functions:
 * \li \c WorldPosition: a 3-tuple vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty that will be linked to the
 * origin of the interactive plane.
 * \li \c Input: (optional) a vtkSMInputProperty that is used to get data
 * information for bounds when placing/resetting the widget.
