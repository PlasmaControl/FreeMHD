/**
 * pqSpherePropertyWidget is a custom property widget that uses
 * "SphereWidgetRepresentation" to help users interactively setup a center and
 * a radius for a group of properties used to define a spherical shape. To use
 * this widget for a property group (vtkSMPropertyGroup), use
 * "InteractiveSphere" as the "panel_widget" in the XML configuration.
 * The property group should have properties for the following functions:
 * \li \c Center: a 3-tuple vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty that corresponds to the center of the Sphere.
 * \li \c Radius: a 1-tuple vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty that corresponds to the radius.
 * \li \c Normal: (optional) a 3-tuple vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty corresponds to a direction vector.
 * \li \c Input: (optional) a vtkSMInputProperty that is used to get data
 * information for bounds when placing/resetting the widget.
