 * entities that use pqApplicationCore and other core components to get their
 * work done. To use, simply attach an instance of pqReaction subclass to a
 * QAction. The reaction then monitors events from the QAction. Additionally, the
 * reaction can monitor the ParaView application state to update things like
 * enable state, label, etc. for the QAction itself.
