/**
 * @ingroup Reactions
 * @class pqChooseColorPresetReaction
 * @brief Reaction to pop up a color palette chooser dialog.
 *
 * pqChooseColorPresetReaction is used by pqColorEditorPropertyWidget (for example)
 * allow the user to change the color palette. It pops up a modal dialog with
 * color presets to select and apply. There are three ways of using this reaction:
 *
 * \li Monitor active representation: To use this mode, pass the \c track_active_objects
 * parameter to the constructor as `true` (default). When in this configuration, the reaction
 * monitors the active representation (via pqActiveObjects) and allows the user to load a
 * preset on the active representation's color/opacity transfer function using the parent
 * action.
 *
 * \li Monitor a specific representation: To use this mode, pass the \c track_active_objects
 * parameter to the constructor as `false`. Then the calling code can explicitly set the
 * representation using pqChooseColorPresetReaction::setRepresentation() method. The reaction will
 * monitor this representation and allow user to load preset of its transfer functions.
 *
 * \li Control a specific color transfer function: To use this mode, pass the \c
 * track_active_objects parameter to the constructor as `false` and then set the transfer function
 * proxy explicitly using pqChooseColorPresetReaction::setTransferFunction() method.
 *
 * In all modes, the reaction will fire the presetApplied() signal to indicate a new preset has been
 * applied. Typically one can hook that signal up to render affected views.
