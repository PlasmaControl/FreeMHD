/**
 * @ingroup Behaviors
 *
 * ParaView plugins can load gui configuration xmls eg. xmls for defining the
 * filters menu, readers etc. This behavior ensures that as soon as such
 * plugins are loaded if they provide any XMLs in the ":/.{*}/ParaViewResources/"
 * resource location, then such xmls are parsed and an attempt is made to load
 * them (by calling pqApplicationCore::loadConfiguration()).
 *
 * Note: {} is to keep the *+/ from ending the comment block.
 *
 * Without going into too much detail, if you want your application to
 * automatically load GUI configuration XMLs from plugins, instantiate this
 * behavior.
