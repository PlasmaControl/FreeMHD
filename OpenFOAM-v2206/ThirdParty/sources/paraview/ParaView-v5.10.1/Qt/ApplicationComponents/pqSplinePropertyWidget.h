/**
 * pqSplinePropertyWidget is a custom property widget that uses
 * "SplineWidgetRepresentation" to help users interactively set points that
 * form a spline. To use this widget for a property group (vtkSMPropertyGroup),
 * use "InteractiveSpline" as the "panel_widget" in the XML configuration.
 * The property group can have properties for following functions:
 * \li \c HandlePositions: a repeatable 3-tuple vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty that
 * corresponds to the property used to set the selected spline points.
 * \li \c Closed: (optional) a 1-tuple vtkSMIntVectorProperty that
 * corresponds to the boolean flag indicating if the spline should be closed at end points.
 * \li \c Input: (optional) a vtkSMInputProperty that is used to get data
 * information for bounds when placing/resetting the widget.
 * This widget can also be used for a poly-line instead of a spline. For this mode, use
 * "InteractivePolyLine" as the "panel_widget" in the XML configuration.
