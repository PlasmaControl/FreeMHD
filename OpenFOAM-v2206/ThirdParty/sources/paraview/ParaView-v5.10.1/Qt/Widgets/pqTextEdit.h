/**
 * pqTextEdit is a specialization of QTextEdit which provide a
 * editingFinished() signal and a textChangedAndEditingFinished().
 * Unlike editingFinished() which gets fired whenever the widget looses
 * focus irrespective of if the text if actually was edited,
 * textChangedAndEditingFinished() is fired only when the text was changed
 * as well.
 *
 * Important Notes:
 * The editingFinished() signals and the textChangedAndEditingFinished()
 * are *NOT* sent when using the setText, setPlainText and setHtml methods.
 *
 * Also the textChangedAndEditingFinished() is not truly emitted only when
 * the text has changed and the edition is finished. For example, removing
 * a letter and adding it back will cause the signal to be fired even though
 * the text is the same as before.
