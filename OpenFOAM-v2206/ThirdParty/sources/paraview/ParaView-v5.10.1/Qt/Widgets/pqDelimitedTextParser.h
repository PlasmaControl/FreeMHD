  Parses a delimited text file (e.g. a CSV or tab-delimited file), and emits signals that represent
  data series from the file.

  To use it, create an instance of pqDelimitedTextParser, passing the delimiter character in the
  constructor.
  Then, connect the startParsing(), parseSeries(), and finishParsing() signals to slots.  Call
  parse() with the
  filename of the file to be parsed, and the parseSeries() signal will be emitted for each series of
