 * pqTreeWidgetSelectionHelper enables multiple element selection and the

 * Hence, the user can do things like selecting a subset of nodes and then
 * (un)checking all of them etc. This cannot work in parallel with
 * pqTreeWidgetCheckHelper, hence only once of the two must be used on the same
 * tree widget.
 * CAVEATS: This helper currently assumes that the 0-th column is checkable (if
 * at all). This can be fixed if needed.
