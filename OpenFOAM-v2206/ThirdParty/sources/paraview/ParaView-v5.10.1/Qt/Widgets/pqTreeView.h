/**
 * @class: pqTreeView
 * @brief: QTreeView subclass that add ParaView specific customizations.
 *
 * pqTreeView adds ParaView specific customizations to the QTreeView. These
 * include the following:
 *
 * * **Auto-resize**: Oftentimes we want the view to as compact as possible, but
 *   if has up to a certain number of items, it should grow to fit those items
 *   so that the vertical scroll bars don't show up. This is supported using
 *   the `MaximumRowCountBeforeScrolling` property. The pqTreeView will grown
 *   in size vertically to fit the number of items indicated.
 * * **Avoid grabbing scroll focus**: Wheel events are not handled by the widget
 *   unless the widget has focus. Together with change in focus policy to
 *   Qt::StrongFocus instead of the default Qt::WheelFocus, we improve the
 *   widget scroll behavior when nested in other scrollable panels.
 * * **Avoid changing selection state on check-state toggles: Disables updating
 *   selection when user toggle check state of any item
 *   (see paraview/paraview#18157 for details).
 * * **Toggle check-state for selected items**: If user selected multiple items,
 *   and toggles check-state for one of the selected item, the check-state for
 *   all selected items is changed match the toggled item
 *   (see paraview/paraview#18157 for details).

   *
   * Second, by override `edit`, if the edit was triggered because user clicked
   * on a selected item and then toggled its check state, we look at all
   * currently selected checkable items and then set their checkstate to match
   * that of the trigger item.
