/**
 * This is the selection model used by spread sheet view. It manages two
 * operations:
 * \li When the QItemSelectionModel is updated by the QAbstractItemView
 *     due to user interaction, pqSpreadSheetViewModel::select() gets called.
 *     In that overload, this class creates a 'ParaView Selection' i.e. create a
 *     selection source proxy for an ID based selection and set it as the
 *     selection-input (vtkSMSourceProxy::SetSelectionInput) on the
 *     data-source being shown in the view.
 * \li Whenever the pqSpreadSheetViewModel receives new selection data from the
 *     data-server, it updates its internal QItemSelection and fires
 *     pqSpreadSheetViewModel::selectionChanged signal.
 *     pqSpreadSheetViewSelectionModel handles that signal by updating itself to
 *     mark the corresponding elements as selected.
