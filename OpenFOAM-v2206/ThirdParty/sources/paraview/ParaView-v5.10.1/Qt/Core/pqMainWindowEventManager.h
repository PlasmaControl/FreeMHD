/**
 * pqMainWindowEventManager is a manager for marshalling a main window's events
 * to pqReactions.
 *
 * ParaView and ParaView-derived applications have their own main window class
 * that inherits from QMainWindow. The standard Qt approach to intercepting
 * signals to the main window (e.g. "close application") is to reimplement
 * QMainWindow's event methods (e.g. closeEvent(QCloseEvent*)). This polymorphic
 * solution is not available to ParaView-derived applications comprised of
 * plugins, however. To facilitate a plugin's ability to influence the behavior
 * of ParaView's main window, pqMainWindowEventManager is a registered manager
 * that emits signals when the main window receives events.
