Observes high-level ParaView events, and serializes them to a stream as XML
for possible playback (as a test-case, demo, tutorial, etc).  To use,
connect the onRecordEvent() slot to the pqEventTranslator::recordEvent()
signal.

\note Output is sent to the stream from this object's destructor, so you
must ensure that it goes out of scope before trying to playback the stream.
