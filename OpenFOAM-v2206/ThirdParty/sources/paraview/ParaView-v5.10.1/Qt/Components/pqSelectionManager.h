/**
 * pqSelectionManager is the nexus for introspective surface selection in
 * paraview.
 *
 * It responds to UI events to tell the servermanager to setup for making
 * selections. It watches the servermanager's state to see if the selection
 * parameters are changed (either from the UI or from playback) and tells
 * the servermanager to perform the requested selection.
 * It is also the link between the server manager level selection and the
 * GUI, converting servermanager selection result datastructures into pq/Qt
 * level selection datastructures so that all views can be synchronized and
 * show the same selection in their own manner.
