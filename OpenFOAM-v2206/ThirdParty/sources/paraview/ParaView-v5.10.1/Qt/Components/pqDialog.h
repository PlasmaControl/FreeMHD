/**
 * This is a QDialog subclass that is aware of the undo-redo
 * sub-system. Many dialogs show information about server manager
 * objects. The user can change the information and then when he/she
 * hits "Accept" or "Apply", we change the underlying server manager
 * object(s). For this change to be undoable, it is essential that
 * the undo set generation is commenced before doing any
 * changes to the server manager. This manages the start/end
 * of building the undo stack for us. For any such dialogs, instead of
 * using a QDialog, one should simply use this.
 * One can use the accepted(), finished() signals safely to perform
 * any changes to the server manager. However, is should not
 * override the accept() or done() methods, instead one should override
 * acceptInternal() or doneInternal().
