/**
 * pqColorChooserButtonWithPalettes extends pqColorChooserButton to add support
 * for a menu that allows the user to connect the color to a color in the
 * ParaView application's color palettes.
 *
 * When the user selects a color from the color palette, this class will get
 * the color value from the palette and simply apply it, as if the user
 * explicitly chose the color.
 *
 * However, in ParaView, when the user selects a color from the palette,
 * there's an expectation that the color stays "linked" with the color palette.
 * Thus, if the color palette is changed, the linked color is also updated.
 *
 * To achieve that, pqColorChooserButtonWithPalettes is often used with a
 * pqColorPaletteLinkHelper. Simply instantiate a pqColorPaletteLinkHelper
 * instance with appropriate constructor arguments and then linking of
 * properties with the color palette is automatically managed.
