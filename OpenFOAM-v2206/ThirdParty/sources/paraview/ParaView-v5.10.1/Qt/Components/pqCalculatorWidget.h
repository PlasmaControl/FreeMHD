/**
 * pqCalculatorWidget is a property-widget that can shows a calculator-like
 * UI for the property. It is designed to be used with vtkPVArrayCalculator (or
 * similar) filters. It allows users to enter expressions to compute derived
 * quantities. To determine the list of input arrays available.
 *
 * CAVEATS: Currently, this widget expects two additional properties on the
 * proxy: "Input", that provides the input and "AttributeMode", which
 * corresponds to the chosen attribute type. This code can be revised to use
 * RequiredProperties on the domain to make it reuseable, if needed.
