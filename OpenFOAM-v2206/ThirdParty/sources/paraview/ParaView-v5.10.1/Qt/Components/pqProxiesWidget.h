/**
 * pqProxiesWidget similar to pqProxyWidget with the difference being that
 * unlike pqProxyWidget, pqProxiesWidget supports showing of multiple proxies in
 * the same widget. Internally, it indeed creates a pqProxyWidget for each of
 * the added proxies.
 *
 * To use this class, add all proxies to show in this panel using addProxy()
 * and then call updateLayout() to update the layout.
 *
 * pqProxiesWidget supports grouping of proxies in components (separated by
 * using a pqExpanderButton). To use pqExpanderButton simply use a non-empty
 * componentName when calling addProxy().
 *
 * pqProxiesWidget provides API such as filterWidgets(), apply(), etc. the
 * calls to which are simply forwarded to the internal pqProxyWidget instances.
 * Similarly, pqProxiesWidget also forwards signals fired by pqProxyWidget such
 * as changeFinished(), changeAvailable(), and restartRequired().
