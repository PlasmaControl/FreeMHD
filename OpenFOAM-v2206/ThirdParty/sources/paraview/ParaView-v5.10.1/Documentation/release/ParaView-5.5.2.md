ParaView 5.5.2 Release Notes
============================

ParaView 5.5.2 is a patch release. It addresses the following issues:

* Fixed a crash when a ParaView client built with OSPRay connected to a ParaView server built without OSPRay.

* On macOS, the Settings dialog now stays on top of the main ParaView window. This helps avoid losing the Settings dialog and is consistent with the behavior on other platforms.

* Saving to BMP and TIFF file formats has been restored.
