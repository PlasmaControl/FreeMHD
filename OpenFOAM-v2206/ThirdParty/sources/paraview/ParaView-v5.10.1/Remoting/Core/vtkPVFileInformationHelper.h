/**
 * @class   vtkPVFileInformationHelper
 * @brief   server side object used to gather information
 * from, by vtkPVFileInformation.
 *
 * When collection information, ProcessModule cannot pass parameters to
 * the information object. In case of vtkPVFileInformation, we need data on
 * the server side such as which directory/file are we concerned with.
 * To make such information available, we use vtkPVFileInformationHelper.
 * One creates a server side representation of vtkPVFileInformationHelper and
 * sets attributes on it, then requests a gather information on the helper object.
