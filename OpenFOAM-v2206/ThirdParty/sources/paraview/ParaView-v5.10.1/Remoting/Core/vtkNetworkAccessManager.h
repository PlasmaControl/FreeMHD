  /**
   * Creates a new connection given the url.
   * This call may block until the connection can be established. To keep
   * user-interfaces responsive, one can listen to the vtkCommand::ProgressEvent
   * fired periodically by this class while waiting.

   * vtkNetworkAccessManager can  be waiting for atmost one connection at a
   * time. Calling NewConnection() while another connection is pending will
   * raise an error.

   * To abort the connection and cancel the waiting, simply call
   * AbortPendingConnection() in the vtkCommand::ProgressEvent callback.

   * Returns the new connection instance on success, otherwise nullptr.

   * URLs are of the following form:
   * \p \<transport\>://\<address\>
   * * \p tcp://\<hostname\>:\<port\>
   * * \p tcp://localhost:\<port\>/listen -- listen for connection on port.
   * * \p tcp://localhost:\<port\>/listenmultiple -- listen for multiple
   * Examples:
   * * \p tcp://medea:12345
   * * \p tcp://localhost:12345/listen
   * * \p ssh://utkarsh\@medea
   * * http://kitware-server/session?id=12322&authorization=12
