/**
 * @class   vtkGridAxesHelper
 * @brief   is a helper object used by vtkGridAxes2DActor,
 * vtkGridAxes3DActor, and vtkGridAxesPlane2DActor.
 *
 * vtkGridAxes2DActor, vtkGridAxes3DActor, and vtkGridAxesPlane2DActor shares a lot
 * of the computations and logic. This class makes it possible to share all
 * such information between these classes.
 * This class works with a single face of the bounding box specified using the
 * GridBounds.
