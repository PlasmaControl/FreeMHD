/**
 * @class vtkSMRepresentationProxy
 * @brief Proxy for a representations
 *
 * vtkSMRepresentationProxy is a vtkSMSourceProxy subclass that is designed to
 * be used either directly or as a superclass for "data" representations i.e.
 * representation that have an input (as against proxies for annotations such as 3D widgets).
 *
 * @section RepresentationMarkDirty Special handling of `MarkDirty`
 *
 * `vtkSMProxy::MarkDirty` is a mechanism that ParaView uses to know on the
 * client side (i.e. in the server-manager layer) when a pipeline on the server side
 * is "dirty" or has potential to execute on an update causing things like data
 * information to be invalidated. Simply speaking, when a property on a
 * vtkSMProxy is modified and pushed (using `vtkSMProxy::UpdateVTKObjects` or
 * `vtkSMProxy::UpdateProperty`), it calls `this->MarkDirty(this)`.
 * `vtkSMProxy::MarkDirty` invokes `vtkSMProxy::MarkConsumersAsDirty` which results
 * in any consumers of this dirtied proxy also getting the notification.
 * Consumers (and conversely producers) are setup via ProxyProperty and
 * InputProperty connections. For standard data processing pipelines, this
 * mechanism works quite well. Consider a filter proxy, say `Clip`, which has an input
 * set via a InputProperty and a implicit function set via a ProxyProperty. If
 * either the input or the implicit function is modified, it is reasonable to
 * expect the Clip filter to re-execute on an `UpdatePipeline` call. Whether the
 * call will truly cause the VTK pipeline (server side) to
 * execute is not that important. The pipeline may not re-execute and that's not
 * a big deal.
 *
 * Things get a little complicated for representations, however.
 * Data representations don't necessary have valid input connections on
 * all processes where their VTK objects are present (note, representations create
 * VTK objects on all process while data input is only available on the data
 * server nodes). As a result representations have to be explicitly told to
 * re-execute following upstream changes since they cannot rely on their
 * VTK-level upstream. Re-executing a representation means regenerating the
 * geometry or data artifacts for rendering, redelivering them to the rendering
 * nodes, etc. It can also mean cleaning up any caches the representation built for
 * flip-book animation support. In other words, re-executing a representation is
 * non-trivial task. Thus, we want do it only when absolutely needed.
 *
 * The explicit pipeline update is often referred
 * to as "update suppression" and handled by `vtkPVDataRepresentation` and
 * `vtkPVDataRepresentationPipeline`. In short, calling `Update` on
 * vtkPVDataRepresentation has no effect unless
 * `vtkPVDataRepresentation::MarkModified` was explicitly called at some point
 * since the last `Update`.
 *
 * To explicitly call `vtkPVDataRepresentation::MarkModified` for only those
 * cases where the representation must be re-executed, we follow the following
 * strategy.
 *
 * \li vtkPVDataRepresentation subclasses explicitly call `this->MarkModified`
 *     when a public API that invalidates the data pipeline is invoked.
 * \li vtkSMRepresentationProxy overrides `vtkSMProxy::MarkDirtyFromProducer`
 *     to call `MarkModified` on the VTK object if the producer was connected to
 *     the representation via a InputProperty and not a ProxyProperty. The
 *     assumption is that InputProperty connections typically imply pipeline
 *     connections while ProxyProperty connections are other supporting VTK
 *     objects e.g. LUT.
