/**
 * @class   vtkPVHardwareSelector
 * @brief   vtkHardwareSelector subclass with paraview
 * specific logic to avoid recapturing buffers unless needed.
 *
 * vtkHardwareSelector is subclass of vtkHardwareSelector that adds logic to
 * reuse the captured buffers as much as possible. Thus avoiding repeated
 * selection-rendering of repeated selections or picking.
 * This class does not know, however, when the cached buffers are invalid.
 * External logic must explicitly calls InvalidateCachedSelection() to ensure
 * that the cache is not reused.
