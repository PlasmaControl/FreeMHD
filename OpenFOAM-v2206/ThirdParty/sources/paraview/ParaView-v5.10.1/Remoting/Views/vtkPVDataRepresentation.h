   * This is one of the most important functions. In VTK pipelines, it's very
   * easy for the pipeline to decide when it needs to re-execute.
   * vtkAlgorithm::Update() can go up the entire pipeline to see if any filters
   * MTime changed (among other things) and if so, it can re-execute the pipeline.
   * However in case of representations, the real input connection may only be
   * present on the data-server nodes. In that case the
   * vtkPVDataRepresentation::RequestData() will only get called on the
   * data-server nodes. That means that representations won't be able to any
   * data-delivery in RequestData(). We'd need some other mechanisms to
   * synchronize data-delivery among processes. To avoid that conundrum, the
   * vtkSMRepresentationProxy calls MarkModified() on all processes whenever any
   * filter in the pipeline is modified. In this method, the
   * vtkPVDataRepresentation subclasses should ensure that they mark all
   * delivery related filters dirty in their RequestData to ensure they execute
   * then next time they are updated. The vtkPVDataRepresentation also uses a
   * special executive which avoids updating the representation unless
   * MarkModified() was called since the last Update(), thus acting as a
   * update-suppressor.
