/**
 * @class   vtkSMParaViewPipelineControllerWithRendering
 *
 * vtkSMParaViewPipelineControllerWithRendering overrides
 * vtkSMParaViewPipelineController to add support for initializing rendering
 * proxies appropriately. vtkSMParaViewPipelineControllerWithRendering uses
 * vtkObjectFactory mechanisms to override vtkSMParaViewPipelineController's
 * creation. One should not need to create or use this class directly (excepting
 * when needing to subclass). Simply create vtkSMParaViewPipelineController. If
 * the application is linked with the rendering module, then this class will be
 * instantiated instead of vtkSMParaViewPipelineController automatically.
 *
 * vtkSMParaViewPipelineControllerWithRendering also adds new API to control
 * representation visibility and manage creation of views. To use that API
 * clients can instantiate vtkSMParaViewPipelineControllerWithRendering. Just
 * like vtkSMParaViewPipelineController, this class also uses vtkObjectFactory
 * mechanisms to enable overriding by clients at compile time.
