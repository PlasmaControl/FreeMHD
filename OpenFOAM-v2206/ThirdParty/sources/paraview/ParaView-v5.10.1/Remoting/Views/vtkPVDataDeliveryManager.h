/**
 * @class vtkPVDataDeliveryManager
 * @brief manager for data-delivery.
 *
 * ParaView's multi-configuration / multi-process modes pose a challenge for
 * views. At runtime, the current configuration will determine which processes
 * have what parts of data and which processes are expected to "render" that data.
 * While views and their representations may add certain qualifiers to this
 * statement, generally speaking, all views have to support taking the data from
 * the data-processing nodes and delivering it to the rendering nodes. This is
 * where vtkPVDataDeliveryManager comes in play. It helps views (viz. vtkPVView
 * subclasses) move the data.
