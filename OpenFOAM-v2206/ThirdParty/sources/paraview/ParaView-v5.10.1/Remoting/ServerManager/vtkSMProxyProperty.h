/**
 * @class   vtkSMProxyProperty
 * @brief   property representing pointer(s) to vtkObject(s)
 *
 * vtkSMProxyProperty is a concrete sub-class of vtkSMProperty representing
 * pointer(s) to vtkObject(s) (through vtkSMProxy).
 *
 * vtkSMProperty::UpdateDomains() is called by vtkSMProperty itself whenever
 * its unchecked values are modified. In case of proxy-properties, the dependent
 * domains typically tend to depend on the data information provided by the
 * source-proxies added to the property. Thus, to ensure that the domains get
 * updated if the data information changes, vtkSMProxyProperty ensures that
 * vtkSMProperty::UpdateDomains() is called whenever any of the added proxies
 * fires the vtkCommand::UpdateDataEvent (which is fired whenever the pipeline
 * us updated through the ServerManager indicating that the data-information
 * last used may have been invalidated).
 *
 * Besides the standard set of attributes, the following XML attributes are
 * supported:
 * \li command : identifies the method to call on the VTK object e.g.
 * AddRepresentation.
 * \li clean_command : if present, called once before invoking the method
 * specified by \c command every time the property value is pushed e.g.
 * RemoveAllRepresentations. If property
 * can take multiple values then the \c command is called for for each of the
 * values after the clean command for every push.
 * \li remove_command : an alternative to clean_command where instead of
 * resetting and adding all the values for every push, this simply calls the
 * specified method to remove the vtk-objects no longer referred to e.g.
 * RemoveRepresentation.
 * \li argument_type : identifies the type for value passed to the method on the
 * VTK object. Accepted values are "VTK", "SMProxy" or "SIProxy". Default is
 * VTK.
 * \li null_on_empty : if set to 1, whenever the property's value changes to
 * empty i.e. it contains no proxies, the command is called on the VTK object
 * with nullptr argument useful when there's no clean_command that can be called on
 * the VTK object to unset the property e.g. SetLookupTable(nullptr).
 * \li skip_dependency: obsolete and no longer supported. This was intended for
 * vtkSMRepresentationProxy to distinguish between proxy connections that
 * invalidate representation pipeline (e.g. input) and those that don't (e.g.
 * LookupTable). vtkSMRepresentationProxy now handles this automatically.
