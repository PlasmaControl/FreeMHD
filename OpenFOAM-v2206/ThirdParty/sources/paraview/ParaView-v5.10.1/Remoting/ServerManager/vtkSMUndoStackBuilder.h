/**
 * @class   vtkSMUndoStackBuilder
 * @brief   builds server manager undo sets and
 * pushes them on the undo stack.
 *
 * vtkSMUndoStackBuilder records Server Manager changes that are undo/redo
 * able and collects them. To begin recording such changes one must call
 * Begin(). To end recording use End(). One can have multiple blocks
 * of Begin-End before pushing the changes on the Undo Stack. To push all
 * collected changes onto the Undo Stack as a single undoable step,
 * use PushToStack().
 * Applications can subclass vtkSMUndoStackBuilder to record GUI related
 * changes and add them to the undo stack.
