/**
 * @class   vtkSMReaderFactory
 * @brief   is a factory for creating a reader
 * proxy based on the filename/extension.
 *
 * vtkSMReaderFactory is a factory for creating a reader that reads a particular
 * file. The reader factory needs to be configured to register the reader
 * prototypes supported by the application. This is done automatically when
 * the reader's proxy definition is registered AND if it has the extensions
 * specified in the Hints section of the XML proxy definition. It is done
 * with the following format:
 * \verbatim
 * <ReaderFactory extensions="[list of expected extensions]"
 *     file_description="[description of the file]" />
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * Once the factory has been configured, the API to create readers, get
 * available readers etc. can be used.
