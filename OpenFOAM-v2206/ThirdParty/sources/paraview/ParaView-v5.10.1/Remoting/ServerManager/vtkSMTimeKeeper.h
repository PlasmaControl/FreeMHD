/**
 * @class   vtkSMTimeKeeper
 * @brief   a time keeper is used to keep track of the
 * pipeline time.
 *
 * TimeKeeper can be thought of as a application wide clock. In ParaView, all
 * views are registered with the TimeKeeper (using AddView()) so that all the
 * views render data at the same global time.
 *
 * TimeKeeper also keeps track of time steps and continuous time ranges provided
 * by sources/readers/filters. This expects that the readers have a
 * "TimestepValues" and/or "TimeRange" properties from which the time steps and
 * time ranges provided by the reader can be obtained. All sources whose
 * time steps/time ranges must be noted by the time keeper need to be registered
 * with the time keeper using AddTimeSource(). ParaView automatically registers
 * all created sources/filters/readers with the time keeper. The time steps and
 * time ranges are made accessible by two information properties
 * "TimestepValues" and "TimeRange" on the TimeKeeper proxy.
 *
 * To change the time shown by all the views, simply change the "Time" property
 * on the time keeper proxy (don't directly call SetTime() since otherwise
 * undo/redo, state etc. will not work as expected).
 *
 * This proxy has no VTK objects that it creates on the server.
