/**
 * @class   vtkSMProxy
 * @brief   proxy for a VTK object(s) on a server
 *
 * vtkSMProxy manages VTK object(s) that are created on a server
 * using the proxy pattern. The managed object is manipulated through
 * properties.
 * The type of object created and managed by vtkSMProxy is determined
 * by the VTKClassName variable. The object is managed by getting the desired
 * property from the proxy, changing it's value and updating the server
 * with UpdateVTKObjects().
 * A proxy can be composite. Sub-proxies can be added by the proxy
 * manager. This is transparent to the user who sees all properties
 * as if they belong to the root proxy.
 *
 * A proxy keeps an iVar ConnectionID. This is the connection ID for the
 * connection on which this proxy exists. Currently, since a ParaView
 * client is connected to 1 and only 1 server. This ID is
 * insignificant. However, it provides the ground work to enable a client
 * to connect with multiple servers.  ConnectionID must be set immediately
 * after instantiating the proxy (if at all).  Changing the ConnectionID
 * after that can be dangerous.
 *
 * Once a proxy has been defined, it can be listed in another secondary group
 * \code
 * <ProxyGroup name="new_group">
 *  < Proxy group = "group" name ="proxyname" />
 * </ProxyGroup>
 * \endcode
 *
 * When defining a proxy in the XML configuration file,
 * to derive the property interface from another proxy definition,
 * we can use attributes "base_proxygroup" and "base_proxyname" which
 * identify the proxy group and proxy name of another proxy. Base interfaces
 * can be defined recursively, however care must be taken to avoid cycles.
 *
 * There are several special XML features available for subproxies.
 * \li 1) It is possible to share properties among subproxies.
 *    eg.
 *    \code
 *    <Proxy name="Display" class="Alpha">
 *      <SubProxy>
 *        <Proxy name="Mapper" class="vtkPolyDataMapper">
 *          <InputProperty name="Input" ...>
 *            ...
 *          </InputProperty>
 *          <IntVectorProperty name="ScalarVisibility" ...>
 *            ...
 *          </IntVectorProperty>
 *            ...
 *        </Proxy>
 *      </SubProxy>
 *      <SubProxy>
 *        <Proxy name="Mapper2" class="vtkPolyDataMapper">
 *          <InputProperty name="Input" ...>
 *            ...
 *          </InputProperty>
 *          <IntVectorProperty name="ScalarVisibility" ...>
 *            ...
 *          </IntVectorProperty>
 *            ...
 *        </Proxy>
 *        <ShareProperties subproxy="Mapper">
 *          <Exception name="Input" />
 *        </ShareProperties>
 *      </SubProxy>
 *    </Proxy>
 *    \endcode
 *    Thus, subproxies Mapper and Mapper2 share the properties that are
 *    common to both; except those listed as exceptions using the "Exception"
 *    tag.
 *
 * \li 2) It is possible for a subproxy to use proxy definition defined elsewhere
 *     by identifying the interface with attributes "proxygroup" and "proxyname".
 *     eg.
 *     \code
 *     <SubProxy>
 *       <Proxy name="Mapper" proxygroup="mappers" proxyname="PolyDataMapper" />
 *     </SubProxy>
 *     \endcode
 *
 * \li 3) It is possible to scope the properties exposed by a subproxy and expose
 *     only a fixed set of properties to be accessible from outside. Also,
 *     while exposing the property, it can be exposed with a different name.
 *     eg.
 *     \code
 *     <Proxy name="Alpha" ....>
 *       ....
 *       <SubProxy>
 *         <Proxy name="Mapper" proxygroup="mappers" proxyname="PolyDataMapper" />
 *         <ExposedProperties>
 *           <Property name="LookupTable" exposed_name="MapperLookupTable" />
 *         </ExposedProperties>
 *       </SubProxy>
 *     </Proxy>
 *     \endcode
 *     Here, for the proxy Alpha, the property with the name LookupTable from its
 *     subproxy "Mapper" can be obtained by calling GetProperty("MapperLookupTable")
 *     on an instance of the proxy Alpha. "exposed_name" attribute is optional, if
 *     not specified, then the "name" is used as the exposed property name.
 *     Properties that are not exposed are treated as
 *     non-saveable and non-animateable (see vtkSMProperty for details).
 *     Exposed property restrictions only work when
 *     using the GetProperty on the container proxy (in this case Alpha) or
 *     using the PropertyIterator obtained from the container proxy. If one
 *     is to some how obtain a pointer to the subproxy and call GetProperty on
 *     it (or get a PropertyIterator for the subproxy), the properties exposed
 *     by the container class are no longer applicable.
 *     If two exposed properties are exposed with the same name, then a Warning is
 *     flagged -- only one of the two exposed properties will get exposed.

   * is modified, it invokes all observers and the observers set the
   * appropriate flags in the proxies.
