/**
 * @class   vtkSMWriterFactory
 * @brief   is a factory or creating a writer based on the
 * data type information from the output port.
 *
 * vtkSMWriterFactory is a factory for creating a writer to write the data
 * provided at an output port. This is done whenever a new proxy definition
 * is added in the writers group.
 *
 * Alternatively, one can register prototypes using \c RegisterPrototype API.
 * The proxy definitions for the writer proxies must provide hints that
 * indicate the file extension and description for the writer.
 *
 * Once the factory has been configured, the API to create writers, get
 * available writers etc. can be used.
