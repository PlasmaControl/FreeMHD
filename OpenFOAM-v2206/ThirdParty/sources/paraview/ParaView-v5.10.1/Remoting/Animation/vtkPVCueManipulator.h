/**
 * @class   vtkPVCueManipulator
 * @brief   abstract proxy for manipulators
 * used in animation.
 *
 * An animation cue proxy delegates the operation of modifying the property
 * on the proxy being animated to a \b Manipulator. An example of a manipulator
 * is a vtkPVKeyFrameCueManipulator. Subclasses must override
 * \c UpdateValue to perform the actual property manipulation.
 * Just like all proxies involved in Animation, this is a client side proxy,
 * with no VTK objects created on the server.
 * A manipulator fires two kinds of events:
 * \li \b vtkPVCueManipulator::StateModifiedEvent is fired when
 * the manipulator modifies the animated proxy.
 * \li \b vtkCommand::Modified is fired when properties of the manipulator
 * are changed which affects the way the animation is generated e.g in case
 * of vtkPVKeyFrameCueManipulator, this event is fired when
 * the key frames are changed i.e. added/removed/modified.
 * @sa
 * vtkPVAnimationCue vtkAnimationCue
