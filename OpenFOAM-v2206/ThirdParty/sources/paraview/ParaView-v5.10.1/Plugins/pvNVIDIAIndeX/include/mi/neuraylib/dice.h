    \brief \NeurayApiName for implementing distributed parallel computing algorithms.

    The \neurayApiName represents a C++-based application programming interface that provides
    a framework for implementing parallel computing algorithms that are distributed in a cluster
    environment. The \neurayApiName provides an interface to the DiCE distributed database;
    it provides means for creating database elements and storing them in the distributed database
    and for accessing and changing elements of the distributed database.

    Furthermore, it provides mechanisms for implementing and distributing computing units
    called jobs. Jobs enable parallelizing computing tasks on a local machine or in a cluster
    environment.
