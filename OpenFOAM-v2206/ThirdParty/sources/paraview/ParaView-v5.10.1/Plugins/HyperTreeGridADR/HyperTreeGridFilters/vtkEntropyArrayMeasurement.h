/**
 * @class   vtkEntropyArrayMeasurement
 * @brief   measures the entropy of an array
 *
 * Measures the entropy of an array, either by giving the full array,
 * or by feeding value per value.
 * Merging complexity is constant, and overall algorithm is linear in function
 * of the input size.
 *
 * @warning Unlike most vtkAbstractArrayMeasurement, given accumulated data,
 * the entropy complexity is linear in function of the number of bins.
