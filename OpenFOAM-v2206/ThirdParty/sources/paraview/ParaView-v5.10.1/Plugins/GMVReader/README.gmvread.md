# gmvread files

These files are imported from VisIt/VisItBridge, but are originally from Los
Alamos National Lab.

Since VisIt imported the code, it has been relicensed under the GPLv3 and is
now available at:

    https://github.com/CPFDSoftware/gmv

However, the code in VisIt/VisItBridge predates this relicensing and is not
under GPLv3.
