# Looking Glass Plugin

## Introduction

This ParaView plugin supports rendering a ParaView Render View onto
Looking Glass displays. When loaded, it adds a dockable control panel
to ParaView with controls for sending the content of the currently
active render view (outlined in blue) to the Looking Glass display.
