 * @class   vtkUndoElement
 * @brief   unit undo-redo-able operation.
 *
 * This is an abstract class that defines the API for an undo-redo-able operation.
 * One or more vtkUndoElement objects can define
 * a single undo-redo step. Every concrete implementation of this class
 * must know how to undo as well as redo the operation, and save and load the
 * state as an XML.
 *
 * vtkUndoElement, vtkUndoSet and vtkUndoStack form the undo/redo framework core.
