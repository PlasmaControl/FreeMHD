/**
 * @class   vtkUndoStack
 * @brief   undo/redo stack.
 *
 * This an undo stack. Each undo/redo-able operation is a vtkUndoSet object.
 * This class fires a vtkCommand::ModifiedEvent when  the undo/redo stack
 * changes.
 *
 * On Undo, vtkUndoSet::Undo is called on the vtkUndoSet at the top of the
 * undo stack and the set is pushed onto the top of the redo stack.
 * On Redo, vtkUndoSet::Redo is called on the vtkUndoSet at the top of the
 * redo stack and the set is pushed onto the top of the undo stack.
 * When a vtkUndoSet is pushed on the undo stack, the redo stack is
 * cleared.
 *
 * Each undo set are assigned user-readable labels providing information about
 * the operation(s) that will be undone/redone.
 *
 * vtkUndoElement, vtkUndoSet and vtkUndoStack form the undo/redo framework core.
 * @sa
 * vtkUndoSet vtkUndoElement
