/**
 * @class   vtkSquirtCompressor
 * @brief   Image compressor/decompressor using SQUIRT.
 *
 * This class compresses Image data using SQUIRT a Run-Length-Encoded
 * compression scheme. The Squirt Level controls the compression. 0 is
 * lossless compression, 1 through 5 are lossy compression levels with
 * 5 being maximum compression.
 *
 * Squirt produces smaller compression ratio than some other popular
 * compression algorithm. However, Squirt has a relatively high
 * throughput compared to some other compression algorithm. Squirt's
 * performance is optimized for RGBa images, however the class can
 * also work with RGB images. There is no performance hit when applying
 * the lossy comrpession levels.
 *
 * Levels 1 through 5 apply a color reducing mask to the run computation,
 * not to the pixel directly. This is clever in that no new colors are
 * introduced to the image, and as a result one doesn't see drastic changes
 * between the reduced color image and the original. However, when using
 * the higher levels one may get runs that produce visual artifiacts. For
 * example when a run starts in one actor whose reduced color matches the
 * background the background is colored with the actor color.
 *
 * The compressor uses a modified SQUIRT implementation where encode 4-bit
 * opacity information as well. This is needed to improve background color
 * blending for translucent renderings in ParaView.
 * @par Thanks:
 * Thanks to Sandia National Laboratories for this compression technique
