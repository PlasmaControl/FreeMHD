/**
 * @class   vtkInSituPParticlePathFilter
 * @brief   An In Situ Particle tracer for unsteady vector fields
 *
 * vtkInSituPParticlePathFilter is a filter that integrates a vector field
 * to generate particle paths. It is intended for in situ use. The additions
 * to the parallel particle path filter is that the particle locations
 * at previous time steps can be cleared out (ClearCache data member)
 * and restarted connection can be used to continue advecting particles
 * from a restarted simulation.
 * @sa
 * vtkPParticlePathFilterBase has the details of the algorithms
