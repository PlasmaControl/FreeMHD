/**
 * @class   vtkPVExtractSelection
 * @brief   Adds a two more output ports to vtkExtractSelection,
 * the second port contains an id selection and the third is simply the input
 * selection.
 *
 * vtkPVExtractSelection adds a second port to vtkExtractSelection.
 * \li Output port 0 -- is the output from the superclass. It's nothing but the
 * extracted dataset.
 *
 * \li Output port 1 -- is a vtkSelection consisting of indices of the cells/points
 * extracted. If vtkSelection used as the input to this filter is of the field
 * type vtkSelection::CELL, then the output vtkSelection has both the cell
 * indicides as well as point indices of the cells/points that were extracted.
 * If input field type is vtkSelection::POINT, then the output vtkSelection only
 * has the indices of the points that were extracted.
 * This second output is useful for correlating particular
 * cells in the subset with the original data set. This is used, for instance,
 * by Chart representations to show selections.
 *
 * \li Output port 2 -- is simply the input vtkSelection. We currently use this
 * for Histogram View/Representation. Since that view cannot show arbitrary ID
 * based selections, it needs to get to the original vtkSelection to determine
 * if the particular selection can be shown in the view at all.
