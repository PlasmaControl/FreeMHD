.SH Description

.PP
Images are created internally by the \fBIceT \fPlibrary. Sometimes it is
convenient to have a placeholder for a .igimage!null``null\&''
image,
an image that does not and cannot hold data. Null images require no
allocated memory to function.
.PP
If your code has the potential of using an \fBIceTImage\fP
image object
that might not otherwise be initialized, use \fBicetImageNull\fP
to set
it to a null object. This will ensure that \fBIceT \fPimage functions that
operate on it will behave deterministically.
.PP
A null image simply looks like an image with no pixels and has no color
buffers. \fBicetImageGetWidth\fP,
\fBicetImageGetHeight\fP,
and
\fBicetImageGetNumPixels\fP
all return 0 for a null image.
\fBicetSetColorFormat\fPand \fBicetSetDepthFormat\fPreturn
\fBICET_IMAGE_COLOR_NONE\fP
and \fBICET_IMAGE_DEPTH_NONE\fP,
respectively.
.PP
You can identify a null image with the \fBicetImageIsNull\fP
function.
