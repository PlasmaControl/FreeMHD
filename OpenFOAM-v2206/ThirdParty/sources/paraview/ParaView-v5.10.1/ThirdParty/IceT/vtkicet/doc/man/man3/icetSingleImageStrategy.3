.SH Description

.PP
The main \fBIceT \fPalgorithms are specially designed to composite data
defined on multiple tiles. Some of these algorithms, namely
\fBICET_STRATEGY_REDUCE\fP
and \fBICET_STRATEGY_SEQUENTIAL\fP,
operate at least in part by compositing single images together. \fBIceT \fP
also comes with multiple separate strategies for performing this single
image compositing, and this can be selected with the
\fBicetSingleImageStrategy\fP
function.
.PP
A single image strategy is chosen from one of the following provided
enumerated values:
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY_AUTOMATIC\fP
 Automatically
chooses which single image strategy to use based on the number of
processes participating in the composition.

.TP
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY_BSWAP\fP
 The classic binary swap
compositing algorithm. At each phase of the algorithm, each process
partners with another, sends half of its image to its partner, and
receives the opposite half from its partner. The processes are then
partitioned into two groups that each have the same image part, and the
algorithm recurses.

.TP
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY_RADIXK\fP
 The radix\-k
acompositing algorithm is similar to binary swap except that groups of
processes can be larger than two. Larger groups require more overall
messages but overlap blending and communication. The size of the groups
is indirectly controlled by the \fBICET_MAGIC_K\fP
environment
variable or CMake variable.
.TP
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY_TREE\fP
 At each phase, each
process partners with another, and one of the processes sends its entire
image to the other. The algorithm recurses with the group of processes
that received images until only one process has an image.
.igsingle image strategy!tree
.PP
By default \fBIceT \fPsets the single image strategy to
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY_AUTOMATIC\fP
when a context is
created. This is the single image strategy that will be used if no other
is selected.

strategy.
