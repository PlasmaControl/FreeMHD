.SH Description

.PP
The \fBicetCreateContext\fP
function creates a new
.igcontext!\fBIceT \fP\fBIceT \fP
context, makes it current, and returns a
handle to the new context. The handle returned is of type
\fBIceTContext\fP\&.
This is an opaque type that should not be handled
directly, but rather simply passed to other \fBIceT \fPfunctions.
.PP
Like \fbOpenGL \fP,the \fBIceT \fPengine behaves like a large state machine. The
parameters for engine operation is held in the current state. The entire
state is encapsulated in a context. Each new context contains its own
state.
.PP
It is therefore possible to change the entire current state of \fBIceT \fPby
simply switching contexts. Switching contexts is much faster, and often
more convenient, than trying to change many state parameters.

.SH Bugs

.PP
It may be tempting to use contexts to run different \fBIceT \fPoperations on
separate program threads. Although certainly possible, great care must
be taken. First of all, all threads will share the same context. Second
of all, \fBIceT \fPis not thread safe. Therefore, a multi\-threaded program
would have to run all \fBIceT \fPcommands in `critical sections\&' to ensure
that the correct context is being used, and the methods execute safely in
general.
.PP
.SH Notes

.PP
\fBicetCreateContext\fP
duplicates the communicator \fIcomm\fP\&.
Thus,
to avoid deadlocks on certain implementations (such as MPI), the user
level program should call \fBicetCreateContext\fP
on all processes with
the same \fIcomm\fP
object at about the same time.
