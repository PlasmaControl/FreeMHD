.SH Description

.PP
\fBIceT \fPhas the ability to take advantage of geometric data that is
replicated among processes. If a group of processes share the same
geometry data, then \fBIceT \fPwill split the region of the display that the
data projects onto among the processes, thereby reducing the total amount
of image composition work that needs to be done.
.PP
Each group can be declared by calling \fBicetDataReplicationGroup\fP
and defining the group of processes that share the geometry with the
local process. \fIsize\fP
indicates how many processes belong to the
group, and \fIprocesses\fP
is an array of ids of processes that belong
to the group. Each process that belongs to a particular group must call
\fBicetDataReplicationGroup\fP
with the exact same list of processes in
the same order.
.PP
You can alternately use \fBicetDataReplicationGroupColor\fP
to select
data replication groups.
.PP
By default, each process belongs to a group of size one containing just
the local processes (i.e. there is no data replication).

 \fIprocesses\fP
does not contain the local process rank.

None.
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
\fBIceT \fPassumes that \fBicetDataReplicationGroup\fP
is called with the
exact same parameters on all processes belonging to a given group.
Likewise, \fBIceT \fPalso assumes that all processes have called
\fBicetBoundingVertices\fP
or \fBicetBoundingBox\fP
with the exact
same parameters on all processes belonging to a given group. These
requirements are not strictly enforced, but failing to do so may cause
some of the geometry to not be rendered.
