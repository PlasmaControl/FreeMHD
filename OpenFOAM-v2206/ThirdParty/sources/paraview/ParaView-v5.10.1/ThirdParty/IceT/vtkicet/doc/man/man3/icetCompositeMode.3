.SH Description

.PP
Sets the composite mode used when combining images. \fBIceT \fPenables
parallel rendering by allowing each process in your code to independently
render images of partial geometry. These partial\-geometry images are
then ``composited\&'' to form a single image equivalent to if all the
geometry were rendered by a single process.
.PP
\fBIceT \fPsupports multiple operations that can be used to combine images.
The operator you use should be equivalent to that used by your rendering
system to resolve .ighidden surfacehidden
surfaces or mix occluding
geometry with that behind it.
.PP
The argument \fImode\fP
is one of the following enumerations:
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_Z_BUFFER\fP
 Use the
.igz\-bufferz\-buffer
hidden\-surface removal operation. The
compositing operation compares the distance of pixel fragments from the
viewpoint and passes the fragment closest to the user. In order for
this operation to work, images must have a depth buffer (set with
\fBicetSetDepthFormat\fP).
.TP
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_BLEND\fP
 Blend two fragments together
using the standard
.igover operator.igunder operatorover/under
operator. in
order for this operation to work, images must have a color buffer (set
with \fBicetSetColorFormat\fP)that has an alpha channel and there must be
\fIno\fP
depth buffer (as the operation makes no sense with depth).
Also, this mode will only work if \fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
is
enabled and the order is set with \fBicetCompositeOrder\fP\&.
.PP
The default compositing mode is
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_Z_BUFFER\fP\&.
The current composite mode is
stored in the \fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE\fP
state variable.

.SH Errors

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_ENUM\fP
 \fImode\fP
is not a valid composite mode.
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
None.
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
\fBicetCompositeMode\fP
will let you set a mode even if it is
incompatible with other current settings. Some settings will be checked
during a call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP
or \fBicetCompositeImage\fP\&.
For example, if the image format (specified with \fBicetSetColorFormat\fPand
\fBicetSetDepthFormat\fP)does not support the composite mode picked, you will
get an error during the call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
.PP
Other incompatibilities are also not checked. For example, if the
composite mode is set to \fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_BLEND\fP,
\fBIceT \fPwill
happily use this operator even if \fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
is not
enabled. However, because order matters in the blend mode, you will
probably get incorrect images if the compositing happens in arbitrary
order.
