.SH Description

.PP
\fBIceT \fPrequires a communicator in order to perform correctly. An
application is free to build its own communicator, but many will simply
prefer to use MPI, which is a well established parallel communication
tool. Thus, \fBIceT \fPcomes with an implementation of
\fBIceTCommunicator\fP
that uses the MPI communication layer
underneath.
.PP
\fBicetCreateMPICommunicator\fP
is used to create an
\fBIceTCommunicator\fP
that uses the \fImpi_comm\fP
MPI communication
object. The resulting \fBIceTCommunicator\fP
shares the same process
group and process rank as the original \fBMPI_Comm\fP
communicator.
.PP
\fImpi_comm\fP
is duplicated, which has two consiquences. First, all
process in \fImpi_comm\fP\&'s
group may need to call
\fBicetCreateMPICommunicator\fP
in order for any of them to proceed
(depending on the MPI implementation). Second, \fImpi_comm\fP
and the
resulting \fBIceTCommunicator\fP
are decoupled from each other.
Communications in one cannot affect another. Also, one communicator may
be destroyed without affecting the other.
.PP
.SH Return Value

.PP
An \fBIceTCommunicator\fP
with the same process group and rank as
\fImpi_comm\fP\&.
The communicator may be destroyed with a call to
\fBicetDestroyMPICommunicator\fP\&.
