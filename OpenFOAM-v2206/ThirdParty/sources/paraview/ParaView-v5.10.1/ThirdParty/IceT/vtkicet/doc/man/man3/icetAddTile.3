.SH Description

.PP
Adds a tile to the tiled display. Every process, whether actually
displaying a tile or not, must declare the tiles in the display and which
processes drive them with \fBicetResetTiles\fP
and \fBicetAddTile\fP\&.
Thus, each process calls \fBicetAddTile\fP
once for each tile in the
display, and all processes must declare them in the same order.
.PP
The parameters \fIx\fP,
\fIy\fP,
\fIwidth\fP,
and \fIheight\fP
define
the tile\&'s viewport in the logical global display much in the same way
\fBglViewport\fP
declares a region in a physical display in
\fbOpenGL \fP\&.\fBIceT \fPplaces no limits on the extents of the logical global
display. That is, there are no limits on the values of \fIx\fP
and
\fIy\fP\&.
They can extend as far as they want in both the positive and
negative directions.
.PP
\fBIceT \fPwill project its images onto the region of the logical global
display that just covers all of the tiles. Therefore, shifting all the
tiles in the logical global display by the same amount will have no real
overall effect.
.PP
The \fIdisplay_rank\fP
parameter identifies the rank of the process
that will be displaying the given tile. It is assumed that the output of
the rendering window of the given process is projected onto the space in
a tiled display given by \fIx\fP,
\fIy\fP,
\fIwidth\fP,
and
\fIheight\fP\&.
Each tile must have a valid rank (between 0 and
$\fBICET_NUM_PROCESSES\fP
\- 1$). Furthermore, no process may be
displaying more than one tile.
.PP
.SH Return Value

.PP
Returns the index of the tile created or \-1 if the tile could not be
created.
.PP
.SH Errors

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
 Raised if \fIdisplay_rank\fP
is not a valid process rank, if \fIdisplay_rank\fP
is already
assigned to another tile, or if \fIwidth\fP
or \fIheight\fP
is
smaller than 1. If this error is raised, nothing is done and \-1 is
returned.
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
None.
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
All processes must specify the same tiles in the same order. \fBIceT \fP
will assume this even though it is not explicitly detected or enforced.
