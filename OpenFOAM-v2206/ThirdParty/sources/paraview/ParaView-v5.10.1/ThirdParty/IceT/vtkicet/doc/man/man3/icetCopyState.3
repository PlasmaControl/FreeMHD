.SH Description

.PP
The \fBicetCopyState\fP
function replaces the state of \fIdest\fP
with
the current state of \fIsrc\fP\&.
This function can be used to quickly
duplicate a context.
.PP
The \fBIceTCommunicator\fP
object associated with \fIdest\fP
is
\fInot\fP
changed (nor can it ever be). Consequently, the following
state values are not copied either, since they refer to process ids that
are directly tied to the \fBIceTCommunicator\fP
object:
\fBICET_RANK\fP,
\fBICET_NUM_PROCESSES\fP,
\fBICET_DATA_REPLICATION_GROUP\fP,
\fBICET_DATA_REPLICATION_GROUP_SIZE\fP,
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_ORDER\fP,
and \fBICET_PROCESS_ORDERS\fP\&.
However, every other state parameter is copied.
.PP
.SH Errors

.PP
None.
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
None.
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
The state is copied blindly. It is therefore possible to copy states
that are invalid for a context\&'s communicator. For example, a display
rank may not refer to a valid process id.
.PP
.SH Notes

.PP
Behavior is undefined if \fIdest\fP
or \fIsrc\fP
has never been created
or has already been destroyed.
