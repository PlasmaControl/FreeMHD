.SH Description

.PP
\fBIceT \fPdefines its display as a set of tiles. \fBicetResetTiles\fP
will
empty this set. The set of tiles is filled again with calls to
\fBicetAddTile\fP\&.
.PP
As a side effect, \fBicetResetTiles\fP
will also zero out the
renderable window size (specified with state variables
\fBICET_PHYSICAL_RENDER_WIDTH\fP
and
\fBICET_PHYSICAL_RENDER_HEIGHT\fP).
The size will be reset with
calls to \fBicetAddTile\fP\&.

.SH Notes

.PP
As a rule, a call to \fBicetResetTiles\fP
should always be followed
with one or more calls to \fBicetAddTile\fP\&.
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
and \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP
will not work
properly if no tiles are in existence.
