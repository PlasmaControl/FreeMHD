.SH Description

.PP
Set the \fbOpenGL \fPbuffer from which to read images to composite. After the
draw callback (specified by \fBicetGLDrawCallback\fP)
returns, \fBIceT \fP
grabs the rendered image from the \fbOpenGL \fPbuffer specified by
\fImode\fP\&.
This buffer is also used to write back fully composited
images if the \fBICET_GL_DISPLAY\fP
option is on.
.PP
\fImode\fP
is an \fbOpenGL \fPvalue that specifies the buffer. It is passed
to \fBglReadBuffer\fP
and \fBglDrawBuffer\fP\&.
Accepted values are \fBGL_FRONT\fP,
\fBGL_BACK\fP,
\fBGL_LEFT\fP,
\fBGL_RIGHT\fP,
\fBGL_FRONT_LEFT\fP,
\fBGL_FRONT_RIGHT\fP,
\fBGL_BACK_LEFT\fP,
\fBGL_BACK_RIGHT\fP,
and any of the \fBGL_AUX\fP\fIi\fP
identifiers.
.PP
The current read buffer used is stored in the
\fBICET_GL_READ_BUFFER\fP
state variable. The default value is
\fBGL_BACK\fP\&.

.SH Errors

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_OPERATION\fP
 \fBicetGLInitialize\fP
has not been called for this \fBIceT \fPcontext.
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_ENUM\fP
 \fImode\fP
is not a known \fbOpenGL \fPbuffer identifier.
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
None.
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
The check of \fImode\fP
is perfunctory. It just checks \fImode\fP
against a list of known buffers. It does not check to see if the buffer
actually exists or for any other buffers that might be defined in an
\fbOpenGL \fPextension.
