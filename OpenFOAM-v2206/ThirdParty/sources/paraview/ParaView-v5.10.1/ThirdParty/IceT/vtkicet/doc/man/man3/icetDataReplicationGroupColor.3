.SH Description

.PP
\fBIceT \fPhas the ability to take advantage of geometric data that is
replicated among processes. If a group of processes share the same
geometry data, then \fBIceT \fPwill split the region of the display that the
data projects onto among the processes, thereby reducing the total amount
of image composition work that needs to be done.
.PP
Despite the name of the function, \fBicetDataReplicationGroupColor\fP
has nothing to do the color of the data being replicated. Instead,
\fIcolor\fP
is used to mark the local process as part of a given group.
When \fBicetDataReplicationGroupColor\fP
is called, it finds all other
processes that have the same color and builds a group based on this
information.
.PP
\fBicetDataReplicationGroupColor\fP
must be called on every processes
before the function will return.

.SH Bugs

.PP
\fBIceT \fPassumes that \fBicetDataReplicationGroup\fP
is called with the
exact same parameters on all processes belonging to a given group.
Likewise, \fBIceT \fPalso assumes that all processes have called
\fBicetBoundingVertices\fP
or \fBicetBoundingBox\fP
with the exact
same parameters on all processes belonging to a given group. These
requirements are not strictly enforced, but failing to do so may cause
some of the geometry to not be rendered.
