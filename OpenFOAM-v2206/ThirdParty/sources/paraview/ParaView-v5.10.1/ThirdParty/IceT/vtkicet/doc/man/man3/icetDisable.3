.SH Description

.PP
The \fBicetEnable\fPand \fBicetDisable\fPfunctions turn various \fBIceT \fPfeatures on
and off. \fIpname\fP
is a symbolic constant representing the feature to
be turned on or off. Valid values for \fIpname\fP
are:
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_COLLECT_IMAGES\fP
 When this option is on (the default)
images partitions are always collected to display processes. When this
option is turned off, the strategy has the option of leaving images
partitioned among processes. Each process containing part of a tile\&'s
image will return the entire buffer from \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP,
or \fBicetCompositeImage\fP
in an
\fBIceTImage\fP
object. However, only certain pixels will be valid.
The state variables \fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_TILE\fP,
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_OFFSET\fP,
and
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_NUM\fP
give which tile the pixels belong to
and what range of pixels are valid.
.TP
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_ONE_BUFFER\fP
 Turn this option on when
performing z\-buffer compositing of a color image and the only result
you need is the color image itself (not the depth buffer). This is
common if you are just creating an image and are not interested in
doing depth queries. This option is on by default.
.TP
\fBICET_CORRECT_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
 Colored backgrounds are
problematic when performing color blended compositing in that the
background color will be additively blended from each image. Enabling
this flag will internally cause the color to be reset to black and then
cause the color to be blended back into the resulting images. This
flag is disabled by default.
.TP
\fBICET_FLOATING_VIEWPORT\fP
 .igfloating viewport
If
enabled, the projection will be shifted such that the geometry will be
rendered in one shot whenever possible, even if the geometry straddles
up to four tiles. This flag is enabled by default.
.TP
\fBICET_INTERLACE_IMAGES\fP
 If enabled, pixels in images
(might be) shuffled to better load balance the compositing work. This
flag is enabled by default.
.TP
\fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
 If enabled, the image composition
will be performed in the order specified by the last call to
\fBicetCompositeOrder\fP,
assuming the current strategy (specified by
a call to \fBicetStrategy\fP)
supports ordered composition.
Generally, you want to enable ordered compositing if doing color
blending and disable if you are doing z\-buffer comparisons. If
enabled, you should call \fBicetCompositeOrder\fP
between each frame
to update the image order as camera angles change. This flag is
disabled by default.
.TP
\fBICET_RENDER_EMPTY_IMAGES\fP
 If disabled, \fBIceT \fPwill never
invoke the drawing callback.igdrawing callback
if all geometry is
outside the clipping planes of the current projection. If enabled,
\fBIceT \fPwill still invoke the drawing callback \fIif\fP
the compositing
strategy has requested the tile. However, most compositing strategies
do not request images for all tiles. The floating viewport can also
consolidate up to four renderings into one. To ensure that the drawing
callback is invoked for all tiles on all processes, enable
\fBICET_RENDER_EMPTY_IMAGES\fP,
disable
\fBICET_FLOATING_VIEWPORT\fP,
and set the strategy (using
\fBicetStrategy\fP)
to \fBICET_STRATEGY_SEQUENTIAL\fP\&.
This flag
is disabled by default.
.PP
In addition, if you are using the \fbOpenGL \fPlayer (i.e., have called
\fBicetGLInitialize\fP),
these options, defined in IceTGL.h,
are also available.
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY\fP
 If enabled, the final, composited image
for each tile is written back to the frame buffer before the return of
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
This flag is enabled by default.
.TP
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
 If this and
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY\fP
are enabled, \fBIceT \fPuses \fbOpenGL \fPblending to
ensure that all background is set to the correct color. This flag is
disabled by default. This option does not affect the images returned
from \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP;
it only affects the image in the \fbOpenGL \fP
color buffer.
.TP
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY_INFLATE\fP
 If this and
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY\fP
are enabled and the renderable window is
larger than the displayed tile (as determined by the current \fbOpenGL \fP
viewport), then resample the image to fit within the renderable window
before writing back to frame buffer. This flag is disabled by default.
This option does not affect the images returned from
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP;
it only affects the image in the \fbOpenGL \fPcolor
buffer. If this option is not enabled, then images are written at
their natural size in the lower left corner of the window.
.TP
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY_INFLATE_WITH_HARDWARE\fP
 This option
determines how images are inflated. When enabled (the default), images
are inflated by creating a texture and allowing the hardware to inflate
the image. When disabled, images are inflated on the CPU. This option
has no effect unless both \fBICET_GL_DISPLAY\fP
and
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY_INFLATE\fP
are also enabled.

None.

.SH Bugs

.PP
The check for a valid \fIpname\fP
is not thorough, and thus the
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
error may not always be raised.
