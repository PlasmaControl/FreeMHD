# Catalyst

**Catalyst** is an **API specification** developed for simulations (and other scientific data producers)
to analyze and visualize data in situ.

Originally, Catalyst was part of [ParaView](https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview). However,
with ParaView version 5.9, the Catalyst API was revamped quite extensively and release as
an [independent project](https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/catalyst). This repository includes the
definition together with a lightweight implementaton of this revamped Catalyst API.

The documentation describing the details, including build instructions and how to use Catalyst
for in situ analysis and visualization in simulations is available
[here](https://catalyst-in-situ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
