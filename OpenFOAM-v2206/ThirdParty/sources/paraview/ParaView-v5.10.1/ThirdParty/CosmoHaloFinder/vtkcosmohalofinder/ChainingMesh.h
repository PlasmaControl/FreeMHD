// .NAME ChainingMesh - Assign all particles on this processor to a 3D bucket
//
// .SECTION Description
// ChainingMesh takes particle locations and assigns particles to a mesh
// location in a 3D grid so that when an area of interest must be searched,
// only the particles in buckets for that area will be examined.  The
// chaining mesh is designed such that the 3D mesh holds the first particle
// index in the bucket, and that array position points to the next particle
// in the bucket.
