[caching_no_recovery]
Warning: Caching has been enabled, but ErrMgr recovery has not.
         Node local caching of local snapshots is only used when recovering
         a failed job automaticly using the ErrMgr recovery mechanism.
         So this combination of options requires SStore to do extra work
         from which it will receive no benefit.
