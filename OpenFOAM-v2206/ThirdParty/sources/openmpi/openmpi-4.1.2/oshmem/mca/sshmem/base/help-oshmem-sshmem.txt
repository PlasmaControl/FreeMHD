[create segment failure]
The OpenSHMEM "(%s)" plugin in the "sshmem" framework failed to
allocate a shared memory segment via the system call.  This
usually means that there are not enough resources available to memory subsystem on your server.

Your OpenSHMEM job will now abort.

   Server:                %s
   Requested shared
   memory segment size:   %llu
   Specific error:        %s (%d)
