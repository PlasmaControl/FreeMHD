# This directory only exists so that we can separate C compilation
# from Fortran compilation.  Specifically: note that Automake's
# Fortran-buidling rules uses CPPFLAGS and AM_CPPFLAGS.  This can
# cause weirdness (e.g.,
# https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/7253).  So when compiling
# Fortran, we should zero out CPPFLAGS and AM_CPPFLAGS.

# HOWEVER, we have one .c file in the use-mpi-f08 library.  So we have
# to split it out to its own directory / Makefile.am where CPPFLAGS /
# AM_CPPFLAGS are *not* zeroed out.
